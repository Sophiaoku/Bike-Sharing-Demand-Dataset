Predicting total rented by the hour

Submissions are evaluated one the Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE). The RMSLE is calculated as

√(1n∑i=1n(log(pi+1)−log(ai+1))^2)
where:

n is the number of hours in the test set

pi is your predicted count

ai is the actual count

log(x) is the natural logarithm
